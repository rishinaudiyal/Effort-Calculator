					<h2>Functional Ponit Analysis:-</h2>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Functional Points Analysis (FPA) is a software engineering technique used to estimate the size
						and complexity of software development projects based on the business requirements of the
						software. It provides a standardized method for measuring software functionality based on
						function points. Function points are calculated based on the number of inputs, outputs,
						inquiries, internal files, and external interfaces provided by the software application, and
						each element is assigned a weight based on its complexity. FPA is used to estimate effort, track
						progress, and identify areas for improvement during the development process.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<center>FP = UFP * CAF</center>

						<li>FP : Functional Point</li>
						<li>UFP : Unadjusted Function Points</li>
						<li>CAF : Complexity Adjustment Factor</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>

					<h2>Unadjusted Function Points:-</h2>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Unadjusted Function Points (UFP) is a measure of the functionality provided by a software
						application, calculated using the Functional Points Analysis (FPA) technique. It is based on the
						number of inputs, outputs, inquiries, internal files, and external interfaces provided by the
						application, with each element assigned a weight based on its complexity. The UFP is calculated
						by adding up the function points for each element, providing a measure of the size and
						complexity of the software application. The UFP is used in conjunction with the Complexity
						Adjustment Factor (CAF) to estimate the effort required to develop and maintain the software.

									<h3>External Input</h3>
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>
										An external input is a user data or control information that enters the
										application from outside. Examples of external inputs include user data entry,
										file uploads, and sensor data. In FPA, each external input is assigned a weight
										based on its complexity, and the total number of external inputs is used to
										calculate the unadjusted function points, which can be used to estimate the
										effort required to develop and maintain the software application.

									<h3>External Outputs</h3>
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>An external output is data or control information that leaves the application to
										the outside. Examples of external outputs include reports, file downloads, and
										alerts. In FPA, each external output is assigned a weight based on its
										complexity, and the total number of external outputs is used to calculate the
										unadjusted function points.</p>

										An external inquiry is an input and output combination where the user requests
										information from the application. Examples of external inquiries include search
										queries and request for details. In FPA, each external inquiry is assigned a
										weight based on its complexity, and the total number of external inquiries is
										used to calculate the unadjusted function points.

									<h3>Internal Logical Files </h3>

								<dd>
									<p>
										An internal logical file is data or control information that the application
										stores internally. Examples of ILFs include customer records and order details.
										In FPA, each ILF is assigned a weight based on its complexity, and the total
										number of ILFs is used to calculate the unadjusted function points.

									<h3>External Interface Files</h3>

									<p>
										An external interface file is data or control information that is shared between
										applications. Examples of EIFs include data files that are exchanged between
										systems. In FPA, each EIF is assigned a weight based on its complexity, and the
										total number of EIFs is used to calculate the unadjusted function points.

					<h2>Complexity Adjustment Factor</h2>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						The complexity adjustment factor (CAF) is a multiplier that is applied to the unadjusted
						function points to account for the complexity of the software application. The CAF is calculated
						based on a set of 14 general system characteristics, such as performance requirements, ease of
						use, and security. Each characteristic is assigned a weight, and the total weight of all 14
						characteristics is used to calculate the CAF.
					</p>
					<h4>The 14 characteristic are mention below-</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Does the system require reliable backup and recovery?</li>
						<li>Are data communications required?</li>
						<li>Are there distributed processing functions?</li>
						<li>Is performance critical?</li>
						<li>Will the system run in an existing, heavily utilized operational environment?</li>
						<li>Does the system require on-line data entry?</li>
						<li>Does the on-line data entry require the input transaction to be built over multiple screens
							or operations?</li>
						<li>Are the master files updated on-line?</li>
						<li>Are the inputs, outputs, files, or inquiries complex?</li>
						<li>Is the internal processing complex?</li>
						<li>Is the code designed to be reusable?</li>
						<li>Are conversion and installation included in the design?</li>
						<li>Is the system designed for multiple installations in different organizations?</li>
						<li>Is the application designed to facilitate change and ease of use by the user?</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Note:- We are Scale all characteristic which is above mention 0-5.</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>0- No Influence</li>
						<li>1- Incidental</li>
						<li>2- Moderate</li>
						<li>3- Average</li>
						<li>4- Significant</li>
						<li>5- Essential</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Productivity Factor</h2>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The productivity factor is a measure of the amount of effort required per function point for a
						specific software development team. It represents the team's productivity level and is
						influenced by various factors such as experience, complexity of the project, tools and
						technologies used, and development methodology. It is usually calculated by analyzing historical
						data from similar projects to determine the average effort required per function point. The
						value of the productivity factor can vary widely depending on these factors and can range from
						10 to 25 hours per function point for a typical software development team.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Team Level    : PF</li>
						<li>Expert Team   : 10-15</li>
						<li>Average Team  : 16-20</li>
						<li>Beginner Team : 20-25</li>
