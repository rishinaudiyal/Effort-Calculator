					<p>
						A use case diagram is a type of diagram that describes the functionality provided by a system or
						application from the perspective of the users. It shows the relationships between the actors
						(users or other systems) and the use cases (the tasks or actions that the system performs). Use
						case diagrams are useful for communicating the requirements and functionality of a system to
						stakeholders and for guiding the design and development process.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>
					<h2>Use Cases-</h2>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						A use case is a definition of a specific business objective that the system needs to accomplish.
						They do this by describing the various external actors (or entities) that exist outside of the
						system, together with the specific interactions they have with the system to accomplish the
						business objective.
					</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>
					<h2>Actor-</h2>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						In a use-case diagram, users of the system are depicted as actors. Each actor performs a
						specific role in the system, which is called a use-case. More than one actor can perform a
						single use-case. An actor can be a person, such as a customer, or a computer, such as a database
						system or server.

						Use case point (UCP) is a method used to estimate the effort required to develop a software
						system based on its use cases. The UCP method takes into account the complexity of the system's
						functionality, the number of actors involved, and the size and complexity of each use case. The
						UCP method can be used to estimate the effort required to develop a use case diagram and to
						determine the resources needed to complete the project.

						The Unadjusted Use Case Weight (UUCW) is the first step in calculating the use case points. It
						is
						calculated by assigning weights to the use cases based on their complexity and adding them up.
						The weights are assigned based on the number of transactions, the number of inputs and outputs,
						and the number of inquiries in each use case.

						Technical complexity factor refers to the degree of difficulty involved in developing a software
						system or product. It takes into account the complexity of technology used, integration
						required, and customization needed for the end user. It is usually measured on a scale of 1 to
						5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest level of complexity. Understanding technical
						complexity factor is important in project management as it can impact estimated time and cost
						required for completion, requiring additional resources, specialized expertise, and longer
						development timelines for higher complexity.

						The Environmental Complexity Factor (ECF) is a term used in project management and software
						engineering to describe the level of complexity involved in developing a software system that is
						influenced by external factors. It considers the complexity of the business domain, the level of
						interaction with users and other systems, the need for regulatory compliance, and the
						organizational culture. ECF is typically measured on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing the
						lowest level of complexity and 5 representing the highest. Understanding ECF is important in
						project estimation and resource allocation.

						The productivity factor is a multiplier used to estimate the effort time in man hours for a

						development project. The value of the productivity factor is influenced by the experience and
						expertise
						of the development team. A team with more experience and expertise is likely to have a higher
						productivity factor, indicating a more efficient and effective development process. Therefore,
						it is
						important to take into account the team's experience and capabilities when estimating the
						productivity
						factor and effort time for a project.
