# Effort-Calculator

Software development projects require careful estimation of the amount of effort required to complete the project. Effort estimation is important for project planning, resource allocation, and cost estimation. Use Case Points and Functional Points are two popular methods for estimating the effort required for software development projects.

This tool is a Python script that allows you to estimate the effort required for a software development project using both Use Case Points and Functional Points. Use Case Points measure the size of a software project based on the number and complexity of use cases, while Functional Points measure the size of a software project based on the number and complexity of functional requirements.

The tool takes as input the number and complexity of use cases or functional requirements, and produces an estimate of the effort required in terms of person-hours. The tool also takes as input a productivity factor, which represents the expected productivity of the development team in terms of lines of code per hour.

The output of the tool is the estimated effort required for the project, expressed in person-hours, using both Use Case Points and Functional Points. This allows you to compare the results of both methods and choose the one that best fits your project.
